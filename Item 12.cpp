 *
 * Using protected means that StackImpl is intended to be used as a private base class. So Stack will be "implemented in
 * terms of " StackImpl, which is what private inheritance means, and we have a clear division of responsibilities.
 *
 * Using public hints that StackImpl is intended to be used as a struct by some external client, because its data members
 * are public. So again, Stack will be "implemented in terms of " StackImpl, only this time using a HAS-A containment
 * relationship instead of private inheritance.
